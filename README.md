# Machine Learning Projects

This project focusing on Computer Vision which process image input to detect and classify object from annotated label

## ASL Classification

<ul>
  <li>Predict and Classify 29 alphabet from American Sign Language, a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada, expressed by facial expression as well as movements and motions with the hands</li>
  <li>87000 image datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet</li>
  <li>Using Resnet50 Pre Trained model from Keras tuned with Bacth Normalization & Dropout layer, So the total paramaters from the model is 25.673.933 params</li>
  <li>Early stopping & Reduce LR On Pletau as regularization techniques</li>
  <li>Only with 2 epoch and reach 99.75% accuracy & 1.51% loss</li>
</u>

## Rebar Count Detection

<ul>
  <li>Detect and counting rebar (steel bar) in image. Usually use in steel manufactur and construction site and usually managed manually, which is inefic </li>
